## Project Description
Welcome to a VR maze game that has initially no escape from the maze. The ultimate goal is to find a key in the maze and take that key to the maze exit. However, the key and the maze exit are enclosed in an area that is not accessible to you intially. These two areas are enclosed by maze walls that will not let you pass. However, the maze has multiple powerups spread throughout that you can obtain and use to remove any specific maze wall such as the maze walls surrounding the two enclosed areas. There are multiple strategies that the user can use to escape the maze which we will explain in further details below.There are three main components to the maze.
* Using the powerups to reach the key area and the maze exit 
* Obtaining the Key and taking it to the maze exit
* Avoiding the bee swarm that is placed in the randomly generated Maze
