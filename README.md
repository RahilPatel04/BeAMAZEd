## Project Description
Welcome to a VR maze game that has initially no escape from the maze. The ultimate goal is to find a key in the maze and take that key to the maze exit. However, the key and the maze exit are enclosed in an area that is not accessible to you intially. These two areas are enclosed by maze walls that will not let you pass. However, the maze has multiple powerups spread throughout that you can obtain and use to remove any specific maze wall such as the maze walls surrounding the two enclosed areas. There are multiple strategies that the user can use to escape the maze which we will explain in further details below.There are three main components to the maze.
* Using the powerups to reach the key area and the maze exit

* Avoiding the bee swarm that is placed in the randomly generated Maze

## Key Area (Tasks)


## Maze Exit 


## Powerups
In order to be able to complete the maze you will need to find the special powerups that are randomly spawned throughout the maze.  These powerups give the user the ability to remove whichever wall you want in the maze.  Since the game is all closed off at the start, it is necassary for the user to find and use these powerups to be able to complete the maze and win.

## Randomly Generated Maze 

## Bee Swarm
Enemy AI that autonomously patrols the maze trying to find you and stop you from completing the level.  Goal is to avoid the Bee Swarm at all costs.

## Strategies

## Issues Faced
Some of the issues that we faced during this project was mainly with Oculus' OVR controller support with our Unity enviornment.  One day it just stopped working and we were unable to fix the enviornment to get everything working again.  We reverted back to previous commits that we all made, however, that did not fix our problem.  We had to start a whole new project instead.  Another small issue that we ran into was getting the Oculus controllers to interact with Rigid Objects in the scene.  When these objects were picked up, they would float by the users feet rather than stay in their hands.
